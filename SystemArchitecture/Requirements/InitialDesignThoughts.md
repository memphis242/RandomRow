# Initial Thoughts
1. 3 digits, 7-segment displays
1. Use AlfaZeta's flip dot small 7-segment (S7S) displays
1. Single button press to generate number
1. Small button on each digit that disables/enables that digit
1. The digits should be ≥ 60% of the front area of the product and ≥ 80% of the depth
1. Frame would be metal, just for an added coolness effect, and some heft to keep this thing stable.
